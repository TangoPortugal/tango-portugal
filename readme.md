# Tango Portugal

Welcome to the Tango Portugal project! This project is dedicated to the art and culture of Tango, with a special focus on its intersection with Fado music.

## About

Tango Portugal is a vibrant community that brings together Tango enthusiasts and professionals. Our mission is to promote and preserve the traditional Tango dance while exploring its connections with other cultural expressions, particularly Fado.

## Key Features

- **Tango Laboratory**: Created in April 2020 by Alejandro, this initiative aims to develop a methodology to study and transmit non-propositional knowledge that shapes the roots and foundations of traditional Tango Dance.
- **Collaborative Artistic Reconfiguration**: Since mid-2022, Alejandro has been collaborating with Camila Delphim, a talented Brazilian professional dancer. Together, they work on the project "Collaborative Artistic Reconfiguration of the Tango Dance towards Fado."

## Notable Performances

Relevant Fado artists such as Celeste Rodrigues, Katia Guerreiro, Helder Moutinho, António Chainho, Fernando Alvim, Luís Guerreiro, Carlos Manuel Proença, Pedro de Castro, Maria Amélia Proença, among many others, have performed at the Milonga d'A Barraca.
