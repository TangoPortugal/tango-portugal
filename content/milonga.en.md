**Collaboration:** 7 tangos

---

The project is directed by **Professor Alejandro Laguna**, a PhD researcher and professional dancer from Buenos Aires.

**Created in July 1999.** It is the oldest milonga in Portugal and probably the oldest weekly milonga in Europe organized by an Argentine tango dancer.

Its mission is to disseminate the fundamentals and roots of Traditional Argentine Social Tango and the experiences of the Buenos Aires milonga in Portugal.

The Milonga d'A Barraca promotes the link between the environments of the Fado houses and the milonga, through regular concerts in which important Fadistas have performed. A set of memorable experiences since its creation, valuing the cultural roots of both countries without ever losing their commitment to the public, distinguishes the quality of the Milonga d'A Barraca.

The dance floor (Pista), the Bar, and the Hall (Sala) are ready to continue along the Tanguero path that Milonga d'A Barraca started at the end of the last century...

**Looking forward to meeting you and continuing to have your preference.**

Invite your friends for a memorable experience!
