      In Argentina and Uruguay, the term milonga refers to the space where tango
      is danced socially. It is also the name of a rhythm danced within that
      same context.



      Founded in 1999 at the emblematic Teatro A Barraca Bar, under the artistic
      direction and curatorship of Alejandro Laguna, the Milonga d’A Barraca is
      the longest-running Argentine tango venue in Lisbon.



      According to Sebastián Jimenez, an outstanding Argentine dancer and World
      Champion of Tango de Pista (2010), the nights at this milonga “breathe
      intimacy, camaraderie, and that special magic that only tango knows how to
      create (…)”. Its dance floor has been the stage for generations of
      tangueros, who have found in its intimate and authentic atmosphere the
      perfect refuge to let themselves be carried away by the music (March
      2025).



      The Milonga d’A Barraca has become a point of reference for tangueros,
      dancers, musicians, and tango lovers, maintaining a weekly tradition that
      spans generations. 



      Today, it continues to be a pillar of Argentine culture in the Portuguese
      capital.
