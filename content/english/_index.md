    content: "Directed by Alejandro Laguna since its founding in 1999 at the
      emblematic Teatro A Barraca, Milonga d'A Barraca is the Argentine tango
      space with the longest tradition in Lisbon. It has become a reference
      point for dancers, musicians, and tango lovers, maintaining a weekly
      tradition that spans generations. Its nights breathe intimacy,
      camaraderie, and that magic that only tango can create. As Sebastián
      Jimenez wrote in 2025: its dance floor has been the stage for generations
      of tangueros who found in its intimate and authentic environment the
      perfect refuge to surrender to the music. Today, the Milonga continues to
      be a pillar of Argentine culture in Portugal's capital."
