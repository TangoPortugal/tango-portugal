The project is directed by Professor Alejandro Laguna, researcher, PhD holder, and professional dancer from Buenos Aires.

Founded in July 1999, it is the oldest milonga in Portugal and likely the oldest weekly milonga in Europe organized by an Argentine tango dancer.

Its mission is to disseminate the fundamentals and roots of traditional Argentine social Tango and the milonga experiences of Buenos Aires in Portugal.

Milonga d'A Barraca promotes the connection between Fado house environments and the milonga through regular concerts featuring important fado singers. A collection of memorable experiences since its creation, valuing the cultural roots of both countries while never losing sight of its commitment to its audience, distinguishes the quality of Milonga d'A Barraca.

The dance floor, bar, and room are ready to continue on the Tango path that Milonga d'A Barraca began at the end of the last century...

We hope to see you again and look forward to your continued patronage.

Invite your friends for a memorable experience!
