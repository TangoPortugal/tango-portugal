## Dr. Alejandro César Grosso Laguna

Alejandro is an Argentinian (Buenos Aires–born) artist and practitioner-researcher whose work bridges dance, music, embodied communication, and the study of propositional and non-propositional knowledge in artistic transmission. He holds a PhD in Performing Arts, awarded under a mixed FCT doctoral grant between Portugal and Argentina, and completed an FCT-funded postdoctoral fellowship. He works internationally as a tango dancer, teacher, and movement researcher, specializing in the analysis of the interaction between verbal and non-verbal content.

He holds a degree in Music Education, with academic training at the National University of La Plata and the University of Évora, as well as advanced conservatory training. He later specialized in contemporary and modern dance technique and completed advanced training in the _Gyrotonic Expansion System_. He is the founder of one of the longest-running milongas in continuous activity worldwide. Based in Lisbon, his current work focuses on the collaborative artistic reconfiguration of tango in dialogue with Fado, within a broader research program on non-propositional knowledge in artistic practice (“How to think of art from the body?”). His micro-analytical methodology for the study of movement and voice is indexed in leading international research platforms such as [APA PsycNet](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-91177-006) and [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1427658).

### **Autobiographical Summary**

I come from a family connected to the arts — painters, writers, musicians, and bohemians. Both my father, a native of the city of Buenos Aires (now CABA), and my mother, from the province of Buenos Aires, lived through the golden age of tango, growing up to the sound of the great traditional orchestras and singers of the 1940s and 1950s.

I have known tango since childhood, listening to my grandmother Amália sing at home. As a child, I accompanied classical music by drumming on pots and pans, and at the age of nine I followed all dance-rhythm TV programs, copying their steps.

At twelve, I began studying guitar in order to play the music of The Beatles, and two years later I formed my first rock band. From the age of sixteen, I became interested in Argentine folklore and bossa nova.

At eighteen, I began my studies in music and guitar at the Higher Conservatory of Music and at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Buenos Aires, earning a degree in music in 1990. In 1996, I began learning tango with Carlos and Inés Borquez and Aurora Lubiz.

In 1998, I founded the first milonga in Portugal, followed a year later by the Milonga d’A Barraca, from which I began promoting tango dance based on Fado music. In 2024, the Milonga d’A Barraca celebrated its 25th anniversary.

In 2007, I began my doctoral studies, obtaining my PhD in early 2013 from the University of Évora. My studies were funded by an international scholarship from Portugal’s Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT). In 2015, I was awarded an international FCT scholarship to conduct postdoctoral research for seven years, specializing in bodily movement in dance (in musical contexts), its emotions, and the non-verbal and intersubjective forms of its communication with others. I have published more than 30 works in scientific art journals.

In 2022, I began an artistic partnership with dancer Camila Delphim with the aim of immersing ourselves in the emotion of Fado and finding ways to express it through dance. This project is based on our previous experience with tango and on our regular visits to Fado houses. We like to present this project as “Um Abraço Dançado em Fado.”

### **Professional Tango Dancer**

Since the late 1990s, he has trained with notable Argentine dancers, including Aurora Lubitz, Carlos Borquez, Inés Borquez, Nélida Miglione, Jorge Ramirez, Sergio Natário, Alejandra Arrué, and Ana Maria Schapira. His training is supported by over 25 years of dancing in some of the most important milongas in Buenos Aires (El Beso, Salón Canning, Lo de Celia, among many others).

Since 2015, Alejandro has conducted academic research into the roots and foundations of the Villa Urquiza style of Tango Salón. In this context, he maintained close ties with the iconic choreographer and dancer Milena Plebs and studied with dancer Graciela González.

Since 2017, Alejandro has studied Tango Salón (Villa Urquiza) with renowned dancers Alfredo Alonso and Silvia Mucci (“Los Alonso”), a couple considered the leading active reference of the traditional style.

### **Tango in Portugal**

Alejandro was the first teacher to give regular tango classes in Lisbon (May 1997, Ateneu Comercial de Lisboa). In June 1997, he began organizing “la práctica” in Lisbon at ABS Privado. One year later (September 1998), he created the first milonga in Portugal together with Portuguese dancer Solange Galvão.

In July 1999, he founded the iconic Milonga d’A Barraca, in the Santos neighborhood. This project was dedicated to the dissemination of Buenos Aires “porteño” milonga culture and social tango dance. It is considered one of the oldest traditional regular milongas in Europe, organized by an Argentine dancer, in the same venue, every Sunday.

### **Tango & Fado**

Through the Milonga d’A Barraca, Alejandro promoted encounters between tango and Fado for more than two decades. Around 80 fadistas have performed at the Milonga d’A Barraca, including Celeste Rodrigues, António Chainho, Katia Guerreiro, and Helder Moutinho, among many others.

In 2024, Camila Delphim and Alejandro were invited by the production company Fremantle to present the project _Um Abraço Dançado em Fado_ on the television program _Got Talent Portugal_ (RTP1), where their interpretation received significant recognition from the jury as well as wide media coverage.
