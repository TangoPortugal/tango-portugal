## Argentine Tango Classes

\
**“Learning tango as it lives on the dance floors of Buenos Aires.”**

Alejandro is an Argentine **practitioner-researcher, tango dancer** and **teacher,** from Buenos Aires, based in Lisbon, with a **PhD in Performing Arts** (Évora University) focused on non-verbal, cross-disciplinary knowledge (implicit and explicit)**,** and a **degree in Music Education** (Évora University-Higher Conservatory of Music of Buenos Aires)**.**

With almost 30 years of experience teaching Argentine tang&#x6F;**,** his work is grounded in the social dance tradition of Buenos Aires, with a strong emphasis on the embrace, musicality, and the embodied understanding of movement as it emerges on the dance floor.

Alejandro specialized as a **dance musician** within university-level contemporary and modern dance technique classes, working closely with dance teachers and providing musical-metrical support in an academic context. This experience strongly informs his approach to structuring movement, timing, and musical awareness in tango teaching.

He has seven years of **postdoctoral research fellowship**  experience (University of Aveiro and University of La Plata) in movement analysis and the interaction between verbal and non-verbal content, funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, strengthening his ability to observe, analyze, and transmit complex human movement processes shaped by perceptual and psychological factors.

An advanced practitioner of the **Gyrotonic Expansion System** (Barbora Hruskova CNB head reherser), his work with this method has further refined his understanding of body organization, efficiency, and clarity of movement, directly applied to tango pedagogy.&#x20;
