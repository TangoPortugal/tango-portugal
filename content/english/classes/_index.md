**Learning tango as it lives on the dance floors of Buenos Aires**

For me, tango is first and foremost a lived, shared experience: a social dance rooted in the embrace, musical feeling, and the joyful energy of the Buenos Aires dance floor. In my teaching, I aim to recreate that sense of spontaneity, playfulness, and celebration — tango as something lived with others, not performed or analyzed on the surface.

​

Alejandro is an Argentine **practitioner-researcher, tango dancer** and **teacher,** from Buenos Aires, based in Lisbon, with a **PhD in Performing Arts** (University of Évora) focused on non-verbal, cross-disciplinary knowledge (implicit and explicit)**,** and a **degree in Music Education** (University of Évora / Higher Conservatory of Music of Buenos Aires)**.**

With almost 30 years of experience teaching Argentine tang&#x6F;**,** his work is grounded in the social dance tradition of Buenos Aires, with a strong emphasis on the embrace, musicality, and the embodied understanding of movement as it emerges on the dance floor.

Alejandro specialized as a **dance musician** within university-level contemporary and modern dance technique classes, working closely with dance teachers and providing musical-metrical support in an academic context. This experience strongly informs his approach to structuring movement, timing, and musical awareness in tango teaching.

He has seven years of **postdoctoral research fellowship**  experience (University of Aveiro and National University of La Plata) in movement analysis and the interaction between verbal and non-verbal content, funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, strengthening his ability to observe, analyze, and transmit complex human movement processes shaped by perceptual and psychological factors.

An advanced practitioner of the **Gyrotonic Expansion System** (Barbora Hruskova, former head reherser at CNB), his work with this method has further refined his understanding of body organization, efficiency, and clarity of movement, directly applied to tango pedagogy.&#x20;
