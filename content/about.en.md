### Autobiographic Summary

I come from a family of painters, writers, musicians and bohemians. My father was a true follower of the Buenos Aires culture of Tango and its orchestras in the 40s.

I have known Tango since I was a child, listening to my grandmother Amália sing at her house. As a young child, I accompanied classical music by percussing on pans, and at the age of 9 I followed all the dance beat TV programs, copying their dance steps.

At the age of 12, I started studying the guitar so that I could play The Beatles’ music, and two years later formed my first rock band. From the age of 16, I became interested in Argentine folklore and bossa nova.

At 18, I began my music and guitar studies at the Superior Conservatory of Music and the Faculty of Fine Arts of Buenos Aires, obtaining a degree in music in 1990. In 1996 I started learning Tango with Carlos and Inés Borquez and Aurora Lubiz.

In 1998 I established the first Milonga in Portugal, followed a year later by the Milonga d'A Barraca from where I began to promote Tango dancing based on Fado music. In 2024, the Barraca milonga will celebrate its 25th anniversary.

In 2007, I began my doctoral studies, obtaining my PhD Degree in early 2013 from the University of Évora. My studies were funded by an international scholarship from the Foundation for Science and Technology of Portugal (FCT). In 2015 I was awarded an international scholarship from the FCT to carry out Postdoctoral research for 7 years, specializing in body dance movement (in contexts with music), its emotions and the non-verbal and intersubjective forms of its communication with others. I have published 30 works in scientific journals of art.

In 2022 I began an artistic partnership with the dancer Camila Delphim with the aim of immersing ourselves in the emotion of Fado and finding ways to express this through dance. This project is based on our previous experience with tango and our regular visits to Fado houses. We like to present this project as "Um abraço dançado em Fado" (An embrace danced in Fado).

### Professional Tango Dancer

Since the late 90’s, he has trained with notable Argentinian dancers including Aurora Lubitz, Carlos Borquez, Inés Borquez, Nélida Miglione, Jorge Ramirez, Sergio Natário, Alejandra Arrué, Ana Maria Schapira. His training is supported by the experience of dancing in some of the most important Buenos Aires milongas for more than 25 years (El Beso, Salón Canning, Lo de Celia, among many others).

Since 2015, Alejandro has been academically investigating the roots and foundations of the Villa Urquiza style of **Tango Salón**. In this context he has maintained close ties with the iconic choreographer and dancer Milena Plebs, and studied with the dancer Graciela González.

Since 2017, Alejandro has been studying ‘Tango Salón’ (Villa Urquiza) with the renowned dancers Alfredo Alonso and Silvia Mucci ('Los Alonso'), a couple considered the principal active reference of the traditional style.

### Tango in Portugal

Alejandro was the first teacher to give regular Tango classes in Lisbon (May 1997, Athenéu Comercial of Lisbon). In June 1997 he began to organize ‘the práctica’ in Lisbon at ABS Privado. A year later (September 1998) he created the first milonga in Portugal together with the Portuguese dancer Solange Galvão.

In July 1999, he founded the iconic **Milonga d'A Barraca**, in the neighbourhood of Santos. This project was dedicated to disseminating the Buenos Aires culture of milonga “porteña” and tango social dance. It is considered one of the oldest traditional regular milongas in Europe, organized by an Argentine dancer, in the same space every Sunday.

### Tango & Fado

Through the Milonga d'A Barraca, Alejandro has promoted encounters between **Tango** and **Fado** for over two decades. Around 80 fadistas have performed at the Milonga d'A Barraca, including Celeste Rodrigues, António Chainho, Katia Guerreiro, and many others.

In 2024, Camila and Alejandro are presenting their interpretation, named “an embrace danced in Fado”, in Got Talent Portugal (semi-finalists).
