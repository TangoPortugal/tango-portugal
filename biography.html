    of Arts, National University of La Plata (UNLP). &nbsp;<br />
    During the last years Alejandro was part of two research competitive
    projects. The PICT-2008-0927, &quot;Intersections between musical experience
    and early childhood in the framework of corporate cognition and the
    PICT-2013-0368 &quot;Communicative Musicality In the Time Arts and Early

    Since 2014, he has taught in Doctorate, Masters and Degree seminars at the
    Faculty of Human Kinetics of the University of Lisbon; no Laboratory for the
    Study of Musical Experience (UNLP), Argentina; and Dance Faculty of
    University Autonomous of Chiapas, Mexico.&nbsp; <br />
    Alejandro has more than 15 years experience as
    <strong>DANCE MUSICIAN</strong> specialized in modern and contemporary dance
    (Assistant Professor of the Lisbon Higher School of Dance) highlighting his
    collaboration with the dancer Antonio Carallo (Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina
    Bausch) for five years. ​<br />
    Alejandro was the first teacher to give regular Tango classes in Lisbon
    (1997, Athenéu Comercial of Lisbon). In September 1998 he created the first
    milonga in Portugal (Rua de Santo Amaro 8, Campo de Ourique) together with
    the Portuguese dancer Solange Galvão. During 1999 they founded three other
    milongas. The first in the bairro de Madragoa in the Vendedores de Jornais
    Futebol Club (early 1999), the second in the Club Estefânia (late 1999), and
    the third in the Santos neighborhood, the iconic Milonga d'A Barraca
    (July1999). All projects dedicated to disseminating the cultural identity of
    the milonga 'porteña' and tango social dance.<br />
    The <strong>MILONGA d'A BARRACA</strong> takes place in the mythical Bar of
    the <strong>A Barraca Theater - Cinearte</strong> and is directed by
    Alejandro weekly since 1999. It is considered the oldest traditional milonga
    in Europe - 23 years old - organized by an Argentine dancer, in the same
    space and on the same day.<br />
    The originality of Alejandro&rsquo;s Milonga d'A Barraca is also to promote
    the encounter between <strong>TANGO and FADO</strong>. In this meeting
    &quot;inside the milonga with the same light as a Fado house&quot; a magical
    moment has been taking place for two decades reserved for &quot;dancing the
    fado&quot; through a free interpretation of the tango figures. <br />
    Relevant Fado artists such as Celeste Rodrigues, Katia Guerreiro, Helder
    Moutinho, António Chainho, Fernando Alvim, Luís Guerreiro, Carlos Manuel
    Proença, Pedro de Castro, Maria Amélia Proença among many other important
    Fado artists (around 80) have performed at the Milonga d'A Barraca.&nbsp;<br />
    In April 2020 Alejandro created a <strong>TANGO LABORATORY</strong> that
    aims to develop a methodology to study and transmit non-propositional
    knowledge that shapes the roots and foundations of traditional Tango
    Dance.<br />
    Since mid-2022 he has been a dance partner with
    <strong>Camila Delphim</strong>, a talented Brazilian profissional dancer
    born in the state of Rio de Janeiro who was a finalist in the World Tango
    Dance Tournament (Buenos Aires) in the stage category. Camila thus joins the
    project
