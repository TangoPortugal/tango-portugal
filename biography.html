  <br />
  <strong>Dance</strong>. Training in Movement technique, basics of classical technique and Gyrotonic Expanded System for 10 years with Barbora Hruskova (Principal dancer of the National Ballet Company of Portugal and current ballet master of the company). <br />
  His main teachers and references in Tango Dance were Carlos and Inés Borquez, Sergio Natário and Alejandra Arrué, Ana Maria Schapira, Milena Plebs, Graciela Gonzalez, Lautaro Cancela, Alfredo Alonso and Silvia Mucci. His experience in tango dancing comes from his immersion in Milongas in Buenos Aires since the last years of the 90s.<br />
  <br />
  Alejandro is the first teacher to give regular tango courses in Lisbon (1997) and created in 1998 the first milonga in Portugal (with Solange Galvão, Portuguese dancer). In July 1999 they founded the Milonga d'A Barraca (MdB) dedicated to spreading the tango soul of the &ldquo;milonga porteña&rdquo;. Alejandro has conducted the MdB weekly and uninterruptedly for 21 years (until the beginning of the pandemic). It is considered the oldest traditional milonga in Europe organized by an Argentine on a regular way. The MdB takes place in the Bar of the mythical A Barraca&rsquo;s Lisbon Theater.  <br />
  <br />
  The originality of the Alejandro&rsquo;s MdB is also to promote the encounter between Tango and Fado. In this meeting &quot;inside the milonga with the same light as a Fado house&quot; a magical moment has been taking place for two decades reserved for &quot;dancing the fado&quot; through a free interpretation of the tango figures. Relevant Fado artists such as Celeste Rodrigues, Katia Guerreiro, Helder Moutinho, António Chainho, Fernando Alvim, among many other important Fado artists have performed at the MdB. <br />
  <br />
  Alejandro is also a musician specialized in dance for 15 years (Lisbon Higher School of Dance), highlighting his work of musical collaboration with the dancer Antonio Carallo (Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch) for several years. <br />
